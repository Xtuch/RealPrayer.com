Ok, so for any reason you need to push directly from the terminal anytime you make changes...

directory of this proyect: C: /Users/.../Web Pages/RealPrayer.com

this  is the text:

C:(From your clone directory) git add . //add all
C:(From your clone directory) git commit -m (message (no spaces, preferably cammel case)) commit message
C:(From your clone directory) git push origin main //pushes the commit on the main branch (this is the case for this website but could vary)
